# What does the developer's survey think about Job Satisfaction?

Introduction
There are many views related to job satisfaction in the technical field. Let me ask you a few of those, What do you think about job satisfaction? Is it salary? Is it employment type? Is it company type? Are hobby programmers are the happiest in the group? Should you consider open source contributions?
So clearly there are a lot of questions, personally, I have a lot of those but I want to talk about a few of these to understand job satisfaction, it is not about one good parameter which can decide the job satisfaction level, however in the dataset, we’ll possibly explore the hidden patterns, Let’s dive into that, I have few questions for you

“Is empoyment status related to job statisfaction?”
“Do you have programming as a hobby or contribute to open source projects?”
“Does Salary gives you job satisfaction?”

We’re using StackOverflow developer survey 2017, I want to take a closer look at these questions related to job satisfaction. The data contain 64000 reviews from 213 countries, the aim of the survey was to understand the job-related aspect in IT.
